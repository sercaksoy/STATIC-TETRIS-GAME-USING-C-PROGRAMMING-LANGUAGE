# STATIC-TETRIS-GAME-USING-C-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE




It is my very first project using C. It is actually my semester project from "Introduction to Computer Science" class. I tried to do my best. I am not saying that it is best also :) . You can send your fixes or comments through email. (sercaksoy@gmail.com)
