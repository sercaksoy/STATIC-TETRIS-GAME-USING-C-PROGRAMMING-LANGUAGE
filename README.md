# STATIC-TETRIS-GAME-USING-C-PROGRAMMING-LANGUAGE




It is my very first project using C. It is actually my semester project from "Introduction to Computer Science" class. I tried to do my best. I am not saying that it is best also :) . You can send your fixes or comments through email. (sercaksoy@gmail.com)


" BLM1011_Semester_Project.pdf " is professors requests. I know my tetris a little bit different from  that but i asked for it and professor said it is fine. 

" screenshots " folder contains different screenshots from the game. In these shots instructions were written in Turkish(my native language) but i translated it into English and " tetris.c " is the new version.
