<p>
It is my very first project using C. It is actually my semester project from "Introduction to Computer Science" class. I tried to do my best. I am not saying that it is best also :) . You can send your fixes or comments through email.</p>

<p>" <i>BLM1011_Semester_Project.pdf</i> " is professors requests. I know my tetris a little bit different from  that but i asked for it and professor said it is fine.</p>
<p>" <i>screenshots</i> " folder contains different screenshots from the game. In these shots instructions were written in Turkish(my native language) but i translated it into English and " <i>tetris.c</i> " is the new version.</p>
